# 🤠 About me
## 🔳 General Information
I am 18 years old, from Egypt. I've started programming when I was 15 years old, the first language I've ever learned was `PAWN` after learning the fundamentals of `C/C++`. I have been developing my skills all those past years, joined a Computer and Data Science college and continuing my career as a programmer.

Most of the time, I am playing San Andreas Multiplayer (SA:MP) and RAGE:MP
